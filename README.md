this is my hackpad thing using xiao 2040 dip. i made it cuz i wanted a small custom pad for shortcuts n stuff. its not perfect but it works fine for me so i didnt overthink too much. wiring is simple, no matrix, just direct cuz i only needed few keys.

i used kicad for pcb, footprints maybe not 100 percent correct but whatever, it fits okay. i will prob fix it later if i get time.

the case i tried in fusion 360, front and back both separate. printing is fine but depends on your printer settings. edges might be a bit rough so sand it or leave it idk.

i am putting the images spots below, will update properly later when i take good pics.

how to use

just plug the xiao in and it works. keys u can change inside the code. its simple. if some key not working, check the solder or wire cuz i kinda rushed that part.

i made this whole project mainly to learn and test stuff so dont expect super pro finishing lol. if u wanna improve anything go ahead, i dont mind.
